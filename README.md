Galaxy's Edge beacons for Astromech Droids

I found Amanda's repo with information on creating your own Astromech droid beacon. I had a Sparkfun Blackboard Artemis board which has BLE and modified Amanda's code for the board along with changes to use the Arduino BLE library.

The Sparkfun Blackboard Artemis board is replaced by the Sparkfun Redboard Artemis board. The two boards are pretty much identical so the code should work on either board. You can find out more here https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15444

You can learn more about Astromech droid beacons here https://github.com/amandagrice/astromech. NOTE: it appears that the repo was removed and this link is dead :-(
